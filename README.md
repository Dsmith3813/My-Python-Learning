# Python Learning Stuff
A place where I display my bad codding while learning.

I'm just now, 3-03-2023 learning how to use GitHub. A friend suggested that I use GitHub as I might learn from others that may help me by suggesting better ways of doing things in python. Right now I'm using VScode, Python 3.10. something on aApple MBP M1. Planning to going to python V11 soon. I'm thinking about 11.1 as a safe upgrade.

I don't know how to use GitHub for learning, but here I am and I'll be reading the doc's.

- `Barista Bot`

My first program, or should I call it a script, was not Hello World, but a robotic barista. The YouTube channel for #NetworkChuck has a tutorial that I followed, coffee shop I think. And then changed the requirments a bit. See `Barista.py` for the code. I will add more as time permits. I do have a GUI versions that I'm putting the finishing touches to. The GUI version looks clucky to my eyes, but it was my first attempt to code GUI on a non mainframe environment.

- `World Simulation`

World simulation program II. A project I though of doing and then modify as I get better writting code. There has been three versions.

- `Egnigma Device`

More information comming as I get into the code and get it functionable. Has some twists.
