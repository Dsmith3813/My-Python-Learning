# Python-Learning-stuff
A place where I display my bad codding while learning.

I'm just now, 3-03-2023 learning how to use GitHub. A friend suggested that I use GitHub as I might learn from others that may help me by suggesting better was of doing things in python. Right now I'm using VScode, Python 3.10. something. Planning to going to V11 soon.

I don't know how to use GitHub for learning, but here I am and I'll be reading the doc's.

My first program, or should I call it a script, was not Hello World, but a robotic barista. The YouTube channel for NetworkChuck has a tutorial that I followed. And then changed a bit. I have always been a coder that just writes code, not considering correct spelling. However, when I misspell, it is consistent. If your wondering, I used a spell check for this read me.

See Barista.py for the code. I will add more as time permits.
