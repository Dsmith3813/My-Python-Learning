# Python-Learning-stuff
A place where I display my bad codding while learning.

I'm just now, 3-03-2023 learning how to use GitHub. A friend suggested that I use GitHub as I might learn from others that may help me by suggesting better ways of doing things in python. Right now I'm using VScode, Python 3.10. something on aApple MBP M1. Planning to going to python V11 soon. I'm thinking about 11.1 as a safe upgrade.

I don't know how to use GitHub for learning, but here I am and I'll be reading the doc's.

My first program, or should I call it a script, was not Hello World, but a robotic barista. The YouTube channel for #NetworkChuck has a tutorial that I followed, coffee shop I think. And then changed the requirments a bit. I have always been a coder that just types out the code, not considering correct spelling. However, when I misspell, it is consistent. If your wondering, I used a spell check for this read me. But, I think there maybe an error or two.

See Barista.py for the code. I will add more as time permits.
