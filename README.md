# Python Learning Stuff
A place where I display my bad codding while learning.

I'm just now, 3-03-2023 learning how to use GitHub. A friend suggested that I use GitHub as I might learn from others that may help me by suggesting better ways of doing things in python. Right now I'm using VScode, Python 3.11.3 on a Apple MBP M1.

I don't know how to use GitHub for learning, but here I am and I'll be reading the doc's.

My first programs, or should I call it a script, was not Hello World, but a robotic barista. The YouTube channel for #NetworkChuck has a tutorial that I followed, coffee shop I think. And then changed the requirments a bit. See `Barista` for the code. I will add more as time permits. The GUI version is coded for macos.

- `Barista.py`
- `BaristaGUI.py`

World simulation program II. A project I though of doing and then modify as I get better writting code. There has been three versions. While the program runs, it takes more than forever to run. Needs more work.

- `World Simulation`

My hobby is photography, and I store backups of my images off site. One of my servies has a dumb 1gb file size upload. So, I create this speciatly backup to create 1 gb zip files of the images. If anyone has suggestion to make this better, I'm open. I would like to make the file progress better looking. Also, Python doesn't support passwords on zip files when your writting the file. I would like this option.

Enigma: More information comming as I get into the code and get it functionable. Has some twists.

I decided to write a paper for this project. One reason is so I can get some thrird party to test if it is even more unbreakable. The code is complete, I need to decide when I will update it to geiHub.

- `Enigma Device`
