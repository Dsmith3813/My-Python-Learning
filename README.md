# Python-Learning-stuff
A place where I display my bad codding while learning.

I'm just now, 3-03-2023 learning how to use GitHub. A friend suggested that I use GitHub as I might learn from others that may help me by suggesting better ways of doing things in python. Right now I'm using VScode, Python 3.10. something on aApple MBP M1. Planning to going to python V11 soon. I'm thinking about 11.1 as a safe upgrade.

I don't know how to use GitHub for learning, but here I am and I'll be reading the doc's.

Barista Bot

My first program, or should I call it a script, was not Hello World, but a robotic barista. The YouTube channel for #NetworkChuck has a tutorial that I followed, coffee shop I think. And then changed the requirments a bit. I have always been a coder that just types out the code, not considering correct spelling. However, when I misspell, it is consistent. If your wondering, I used a spell check for this read me. But, I think there maybe an error or two.

See Barista.py for the code. I will add more as time permits.

My second program World Simulation

World simulation program II. A constant evelution in code.
Just a project I though of doing and then modify
as I get better writting code. There has been three versions, number 2
flopped. The issue I had with version 1 was throughput performace and
memory use. As the propulation grew, the program slowed down and then 
memory was used up. All persons info was held in memory. I tried to go
to 1,000 years, got to 3 billion persons when it died, 26 hours later.

Verion 3 I added a database (to solve the memory problem), DNA and 
fixed some of the events to be more radom. Also, the DNA is also 
randomly built.

The idea of this current world is that everyone works to the betterment of
all. So, everyone's effort is food generation. Food is procces into uints,
a sigel unit feeds one person for one year. The main goal is to have some
percent of food unit surpules. If the population plus 2% (popultion * 1.02)
is greater than the number of food units, people die. Famnime affects
food units. 

Murder has been added based in ones DNA. At this point, I have six bits 
unassigned that I want to assign, just not sure what attribute to add to
the peeps yet.

I am planning having war part of the simulation, just have to think out a 
good mechinisem for war yet.

Gaols; 
Efficant code.
Better memory usage.
Better I/O for accsessing Peeps.
To add AI componets to a Peep, so their actions is really made from their
 DNA.
